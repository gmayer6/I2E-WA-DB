%\item \textbf{Application to Mechanics}\\
%For $t\in\R$, the real valued functions
%\begin{align*}
%y(t)=2+5t, \quad y(t) = \sin(4t) , \quad y(t)=e^{6t}
%\end{align*}
%are referred to as \textbf{scalar functions}, because in each case, they assign a real number $y$, to another real number $t$. However, functions such as
%\begin{align*}
%\mathbf{v}(t)=\mathbf{r}_0+t\mathbf{r}, \quad \mathbf{v}(t) = \sin(4t)\mathbf{a} , \quad \mathbf{v}(t)=e^{6t}\mathbf{b}
%\end{align*}
%assign a vector to real numbers, and are referred to as \textbf{vector functions}. They could be used, for example if the position of a particle is specified by the vector $\mathbf{r}\in \R^3$, and that the particle is moving, so that \textbf{r} is a function of time: \textbf{r}=\textbf{r}$(t)$. 
%
%Many of the properties of vector functions are intuitive. For example, the derivative of a vector function, defined as
%\begin{align*}
%\lim_{h\rightarrow0} \frac{\mathbf{r}(t+h) - \mathbf{r}(t)}{h}
%\end{align*}
%describes the rate of change of $\mathbf{r}$ at $t$ (provided that the limit exists). If the vector \textbf{r} represents the position of a particle at time $t$, then, naturally, $\mathbf{r}'(t)$ represents its velocity at time $t$, and $\mathbf{r}''(t)$ represents its acceleration at time $t$. Moreover, we can compute the derivative of a vector by simply taking the derivative of each of its components separately. For example, if $\mathbf{v}(t) = 5t \mathbf{i} + \cos(t)\mathbf{j} - \mathbf{k}$, then $\mathbf{v}'(t) = 5 \mathbf{i} - \sin(t)\mathbf{j} - 0 \mathbf{k}$, or 
%\begin{align*}
% \frac{d \mathbf{v}(t)}{dt} = \mathbf{v}'(t) &= \BM 5 \\ -\sin(t) \\ 0 \EM.
%\end{align*}
%Differentiation rules for scalar multiplication, cross and dot products can also be derived and resemble the product rule for scalar functions:
%\begin{align*}
%\frac{d}{dt} \big( C \mathbf{u}(t)\big) &=C \frac{d \mathbf{u}(t) }{dt}  , \quad C \text{ is a constant} \\
%\frac{d}{dt} \big( \mathbf{v}(t) \cdot \mathbf{u}(t)\big) &= \mathbf{v}(t) \cdot \frac{d \mathbf{u}(t) }{dt}  +  \frac{d \mathbf{v}(t)}{dt}  \cdot  \mathbf{u}(t) \\
%\frac{d}{dt} \big( \mathbf{v}(t) \times \mathbf{u}(t)\big) &= \mathbf{v}(t) \times \frac{d \mathbf{u}(t) }{dt}  +  \frac{d \mathbf{v}(t)}{dt}  \times  \mathbf{u}(t) 
%\end{align*}
%Other differentiation formulas that you may need throughout this course are provided in your textbook. \\\\
%%\noindent\textbf{Questions}
%Recall from a previous assignment that we defined torque as $\boldsymbol\tau = \mathbf{r} \times \MB{F}$. Now that we have introduced the concepts of vector-valued functions and their derivatives, let's consider the more general case when $\boldsymbol\tau$, $\MB{r}$, and $\MB{F}$ are all functions of time:
%\begin{align*}
%  \boldsymbol\tau(t) &= \mathbf{r}(t) \times \MB{F}(t).
%\end{align*}
%Moreover, using the relation $\MB{F}(t)=m\MB{a}(t)$ (Newton's second law), we can write our definition of torque as
%\begin{align*}
%  \boldsymbol\tau(t) &= \mathbf{r}(t) \times \MB{F}(t) \\
%  &= \mathbf{r}(t) \times \big(m\MB{a}(t)\big) \\
%  &= m\big( \mathbf{r}(t) \times \mathbf{r}''(t)\big).
%\end{align*}
%These alternate forms for the torque vector may be helpful in solving the following problems.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item If the position of a particle with mass $m$ is given by the position vector $\mathbf{r}(t)$, then its angular momentum is a vector defined as $\mathbf{L}(t) = m\mathbf{r}(t)\times \mathbf{r}'(t)$. Show that $\mathbf{L}'(t) = \boldsymbol\tau(t)$.
%\item Show that if the torque is a zero vector for all $t$, then the angular momentum of the particle is constant for all $t$. This is what is known as the \Emph{law of conservation of angular momentum}.
%\end{enumerate}

% POLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATION 
\item \textbf{Application to Polynomial Interpolation}

In many areas of engineering, experimental data is collected that must be analyzed to extract parameters that tell us something about a physical process. Suppose we have measured a set of experimental data that are represented in the $xy$-plane. An \Emph{interpreting polynomial} for the measured data is a polynomial that passes through every measured point. We can use this polynomial, for example, to estimate values between the measured data points. \\

Suppose for example that we have measured the data points (0,-6), (1,-2), (2,4), (3,10). To find an interpreting polynomial of order 2 for these data, we would try to find a polynomial of the form $p(x) = a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2$ that passes through all four measured points. In other words, we need to find the unknown constants $a_0, a_1, a_2$ that satisfy the equations
\begin{align*}
p(0) = a_0+a_1(0)+a_2(0)^2 &= -6 \\
p(1) = a_0+a_1(1)+a_2(1)^2 &= -2 \\
p(2) = a_0+a_1(2)+a_2(2)^2 &= 4  \\
p(3) = a_0+a_1(3)+a_2(3)^2 &= 10 
\end{align*}
The above system has four equations and four unknowns. Upon solving this system, you should be able to determine that $a_0 = -6, a_1 = 4, a_2=0$.\\

\textbf{Wind Tunnel Experiment}\\
In a fictitious wind tunnel experiment\footnote{The wind tunnel problem was based on a similar exercise in Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 4th Edition, by David C. Lay, Addison-Wesley, 2012.}, the following measurements were made. 
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ c c }
    Velocity (m/s) & Force (N)  \\ \hline
     0  & 0 \\
    1 & 5.5 \\
    2 & 20 \\
    3 & 46.5 \\
    4 & 88
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The data represent the measured force due to air resistance, on an object suspended in the tunnel, measured at different air speed velocities.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using the data above, derive a $5\times4$ system of equations, that when solved, find an interpreting polynomial of the form $p(x) = a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3$. Write the system in the form $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$.
\item Solve your system to obtain $p(x) = a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3$.
\item As mentioned above, engineers sometimes use interpreting polynomials to estimate values in between measured data points. Using your polynomial, estimate the value of the force when the velocity is 1.5 m/s. 
\item In practice, it can be difficult to determine what order of polynomial to use. Sometimes, polynomials of different orders must be used to decide which polynomial yields the most useful results. For the above data, explain what what would happen if we used a polynomial less than 3. It may help to see what happens if we use a 1$^{st}$ order polynomial.
