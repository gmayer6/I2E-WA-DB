%\section*{Wolfram Alpha Syntax}
%You may want to use Wolfram Alpha (wolframalpha.com) to check your answers. If you're not sure what syntax to use to compute double integrals with Wolfram Alpha, let's suppose that we want to determine the value of
%\begin{align*} 
%   \mathop{\int_{-2}^{-1} \!  \int_0^{x-1}}( x^{2C} +y)  dy  dx
%\end{align*}
%where $C$ is a constant. The syntax we could use to compute this particular integral is
%\begin{quote}
%  \begin{verbatim}
%    integrate x^{2C}+y dydx, x from -2 to -1 and y from 0 to (x-1)
%  \end{verbatim}
%\end{quote}
%%The syntax for single and triple integrals is similar, and you can probably figure out what would work. 
%Note also that Wolfram Alpha is very forgiving the syntax, so 
%\begin{quote}
%  \begin{verbatim}
%    int x^(2c)y cos(3y) dydx, x in -2, -1 and y in 0, 1
%  \end{verbatim}
%\end{quote}
